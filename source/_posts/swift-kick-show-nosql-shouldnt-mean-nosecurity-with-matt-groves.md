On the April 18th "Swift Kick Show", I had the opportunity to chat a little bit with my good friend, Matt Groves.  However, due to some technical issues Matt was not able to join us live.  That doesn't stop the show from going on though!

Through the power of YouTube and video recording, Matt sat down and did a version of his talk for us to publish. 

Watch the video below, and check out the [Swift Kick YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/swiftkick).  Like and subscribe for more great videos!

### NoSql Shouldn't Mean NoSecurity with Matt Groves

>As NoSQL databases increase in popularity, they also increase in popularity with hackers. NoSQL databases are vulnerable to traditional attacks like SQL injection (yes, really). Further, the rush to productivity leaves some of these databases insecure-by-design. As a result, ransom notes have plagued databases like MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Hadoop, and CouchDB. This session demonstrates security mistakes and prevention. We’ll also look at what NoSQL vendors are doing to mitigate future attacks. Both devs and devops should come to this session, because the last thing either of you want to see is “SEND 0.2 BTC TO THIS ADDRESS 1zaGVjj9NcyvDLyYpCh33Msq TO RECOVER YOUR DATABASE!”
