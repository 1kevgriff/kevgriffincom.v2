During a flight from Norfok to Charlotte, I had the opportunity to read [Ryan Castillo's](https://twitter.com/rmcastil) new book [7 Recurring Revenue Recipes for Freelancers](http://ryancastillo.org/7-recipes-recurring-revenue/).

In this book, Ryan provides seven actionable sets of guidelines that provides the reader a path way to earning $150k a year.  Ryan allows the reader to take a "choose your own adventure" to their career and bottom line.  

This book provides clear ways for readers who are already experienced freelancers or consultants to move their target forward.  If you're new to the consulting game, Ryan also provides some great places to get started.  

Ryan's recipe on developing support contracts with new and existing clients definitely struck a cord with me.  This is a problem I'm running into now with multiple clients, and I'm going to be able to put Ryan's suggestions into action within the next week.  This book has the potential to make me an easy $25k extra each year.  

Many of the recommendations Ryan makes echo throughout the communities I'm involved in daily.  Every day, people are putting these recipes into action and are seeing results!  

Ryan is currently [pre-selling his book for $12](http://ryancastillo.org/7-recipes-recurring-revenue/), which is a drop in the bucket compared to what you will make if you put his receipes into adction.
