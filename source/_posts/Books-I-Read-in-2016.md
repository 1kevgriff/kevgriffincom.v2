Reading is amazingly important.  A long time ago I read a book that discussed traits of successful people, and the number one similarity I saw was that successful people tend to read A LOT.  Since 2016 is wrapping up, I took a couple minutes to look through the list of books I was able to get through.  

My list distinctly separates fiction from non-fiction.  I *love* reading good fiction, and it's just as important for stories and fantasy to be a part of your reading schedule as it is to read non-fiction.  Escape a little!

I'm going to list the books in no particular order!  I won't give much commentary, because I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments.  By the way, there are affiliate links to Amazon.  If you use my link to pick up the book, I'd greatly appreciate it!

[You're Never Weird on the Internet](http://amzn.to/2iM7eVY) by Felicia Day

I picked this book up on a whim. I've been a big fan of Felicia Day since the early episodes of The Guild.  If you're enjoyed any of her work, this book is a quick read and a glimpse into her mind and background.

[MONEY Master The Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom](http://amzn.to/2iLWcjI) by Tony Robbins

I think a lot about personal finance, and how to prepare myself and my family for the future.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone with no basic understand of personal finance.  It goes DEEP quickly, and I'm anticipating multiple reads to get the full value out of it.

[How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://amzn.to/2hzRDLD) by Dale Carnegie

My first time reading this book.  Not my last.  If you deal with people at all, it is a must read.

[The Big Fat Surprise](http://amzn.to/2hzXFfa) by Nina Teicholz

I've tackled weight problems for most of my life.  The best success I've ever had has been on the ketogentic diet.  Traditional philosophy failed me.  Come to find out, traditional thinking on diets is completely wrong, and possibly killing people.  This book provides a ton of research and science into why we've been lied to regarding nutrition.  

As a side note, I've done a bit of research outside of this book and I tend to agree with most of what it says.  Everyone is different, so do your own research and form your own opinions.

[How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big](http://amzn.to/2iNicim) by Scott Adams

Also picked up on a whim.  If you feel like you're failing or not progressing fast enough, give this book a read.  Scott Adams is the guy who write Dilbert.  That wasn't an overnight success.  There were dozens of failed experiments before Dilbert, all providing Scott Adams with new knowledge and skills.  And it's funny!  Well worth your time.

[The 4-Hour Body](http://amzn.to/2iMEuN6) by Tim Ferris

I like how Tim Ferris forms opinions by experimenting on himself, and usually in the presence of an expert.  Take a lot of his advice with a grain of salt.  Do your own research.  SHORT read.  The Audible version of this book is 4-5 hours long.

[Never Split the Difference](http://amzn.to/2hCtDJw) by Chris Voss

My favorite book of the year.  Chris Voss is an ex-FBI negotiator.  He goes into details about how you can use the tactics of the FBI for negotiating can benefit you in business and in life.  Must read!

[Ready Player One](http://amzn.to/2hAc9eX) by Ernest Cline

A very enjoyable book to read!  Especially as VR is becoming more of a "thing", you can see the horizon of this futuristic book coming forth.

[Redshirts](http://amzn.to/2hA3SYz) by John Scalzi

Imagine Star Trek, and the "redshirts" figure out they always die on away missions.  Take that idea and RUNNNNNN with it.

[Order to Kill](http://amzn.to/2iMLoC4) by Vince Flynn and Kyle Mills

I'm a huge fan of spy, counter-intelligence type of books.  The Mitch Rapp character is one of my favorites.  Sadly, the author Vince Flynn passed away a couple years ago.  However, the character lives on through a new author!

[Running Blind](http://amzn.to/2ifAjMC) by Lee Child

Jack Reacher books scratch the same itch as Mitch Rapp does.  If you've seen the movie, the book series is 1000x better!  While this isn't the best book in the series, it was still good on it's own.
