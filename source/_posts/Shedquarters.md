## May 25th, 2017
Since 2009, I have worked out of my home office, the FROG (finished room over garage).  Since then, life has changed a bit.  I have three awesome little boys who are growing up to be school age, and my wife and I need a part of the house dedicated to homeschooling.

The FROG is the obvious location.  When you have three kids, room to spare is a luxuary not often found. 

But in order to use the FROG for homeschooling, I need to vacate.  I could've rented office space for $750-$1500 per month.  But have you ever tried to RENT a single or double office?  They're **really** hard to find at reasonable rates.

And I like working at home.  Adding a commute back into day to day would really put a bummer on my personal and business life.  There needed to be a better alternative.

Today, I bought my **Shedquarters**.

The pictures above show the "base" model of the building I'm buying.  My shed will have a real door on the right hand corner, and windows going all the way around.

And the entire thing will be unfinished.  Part of my fun is insulating, drywalling, and running power/internet out to the building.

This post will be a story of the work I do on my Shedquarters, and also an overview of the costs associated with owning it.
