<p>After four years with my current company, Antech Systems, it is time for me to pack up and move on to greener pastures.&#160; </p>  <p>I would like to publically thank Antech for providing me with a foundation to build my career off of.&#160; I came to Antech as a college newbie, recently laid off from Symantec, with no .NET experience of any kind.&#160; Within weeks, I was able to grow into a position where I was not only functional, but able to provide meaningful feedback about the applications being built and the processes use to build them.&#160; Antech was the reason I found the developer community, and was one of the leading reasons why I started the <a href="http://www.hrnug.org">Hampton Roads .NET Users Group</a>.&#160; Without them, I have no idea where I would be right now.</p>  <p>I’m pleased to announce that on June 1st, 2011, I’ll be starting my new position with ComponentOne as a Technical Evangelist.&#160; </p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http://www.componentone.com/newimages/Company/Logos/c1_logo_vertical_black_128.png" /></p>  <p>In this position, I’ll be working closely with <a href="http://helpcentral.componentone.com/CS/evangelists/b/rich_dudley/default.aspx">Rich Dudley</a> to help promote ComponentOne in the developer community.&#160; As a Technical Evangelist, it is my goal to help you all in your communities in anyway possible.&#160; Please feel free to use me as a resource.</p>  <p>If you’re going to be in the Kansas City area on June 25th, come out to the <a href="http://kcdc.info/">Kansas City Developer Conference</a> to see me!&#160; I’ll be talking about MVVM!&#160; If you’re in the area, you should definitely come out.</p>
