I've worked with a lot of different events.  User groups, code camps, MADExpo (I'd link to it, but sadly the site went away a couple months ago), and others.

They are always the same.  *If you build it, they will come.*

I really don't want that to sound negative, because it's not meant to.  The leaders in the community are amazing, and lose a lot of sleep making sure an event is a success.  And if it's a free event, they do all that knowing that potentially over 30-50% of the people that promised to attend will skip.

Heck, even a paid event isn't much better.  When we cancelled MADExpo in 2013, I received numerous comments from people saying "Oh, I was looking so forward to MADExpo this year!"  That's awesome!  Why didn't buy a ticket?  

Since the cancellation of MADExpo, I've been itching to do something new in our area.  However, the model of *build it, and they come* didn't seem like it worked anymore.  At least, not for a new event.

By the pressure of my partner-in-crime, [Bret Fisher](http://fishbrains.com), I've been listening through [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4XGN6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004J4XGN6&linkCode=as2&tag=kevgr-20).  The chapter on building a minimum viable product struct a chord with me.  Build the absolute minimum to start the learning process of what people want.

Over the course of two days, I built the minimum viable product for [757DevCon](http://757devcon.com).  It's strictly an interest site.  I'm throwing out an idea, and you can register for my list if you want to hear more.

Behind the scenes, I have a series of emails planned out to extract crucial information I need from my potential customers.  It's not so much about what they want from a conference, but what are they willing to pay for?

So what are you waiting for?  Go [get on the list](http://757devcon.com), and I'll keep you updated!

I'd love to hear your questions and thoughts.  Post them in the comments below.
