<p>When my wife and I bought our house back in April, one of my pet projects has been to renovate the room over our garage.&#160; I knew buying the house that it would be a lot of work, partly because the previous owner didn’t know what he was doing when finishing a room.&#160; I’ve spent the last week and half sanding, mudding, and fixing all the walls in this room.&#160; While sanding some dried mud tonight, I had a thought about how this experience was a lot like building software.</p>  <p align="left">When building software, you’re not sometimes lucky enough to build a system from the ground up.&#160; Normally, you’ll inherit code from developers who have been hacking it for years.&#160; I related this to me working in my room.&#160; I inherited a poorly maintained room.&#160; The joints weren’t level with each other and the mud of the wall wasn’t smooth.&#160; The person doing the work took no pride in the work being done.&#160; The ceiling was also a “hacked” popcorn ceiling.&#160; I say hacked because, instead of using a hopper, the person slung dry wall mud onto the ceiling giving the illusion of popcorn.&#160; The illusion failed though because it looked horrible.</p>  <p align="left">Fast forward to my work in the room last week.&#160; I had to go through and scrap all the excess mud off the wall.&#160; Each wall and joint had to be sanded, and mudded again in order to level everything.&#160; I’ve spend hours of time trying to reverse the effects caused by performing the job incorrectly.</p>  <p align="left">What does this have to do with software development?&#160; Think about when you’re working on a bug in a piece of code, and it’s your first time looking at this code.&#160; How the previous developer left the code is how you’re going to inherit it.&#160; You might have to spend hours undoing the work of the previous person in order to get the code to a state it can be worked with.&#160; Hacks might have to be removed and properly implemented.&#160; Hours will be wasted that didn’t have to be.</p>  <p align="left">When working on new code, do yourself and future developers a favor and leave the code in a state where it can be easily picked up and worked on.&#160; If you’re working on existing code, try to leave it in a better state than it was when you found it.&#160; In the long run, time will be saved, code will be more secure, and a developer will say fewer curse words.</p>
