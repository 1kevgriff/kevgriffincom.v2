> This post is a part of a series I wanted to do on simple user group management tips.

When you visit a user group, the person standing at the computer is most likely not being paid.  In fact, a large majority of the technical speaker circuit is filled with unpaid speakers.  Not only that, the speaker might incur costs just for having come out.

**What costs would a speaker have?**  
Great question!  

* **Gas**  
Let's imagine someone is driving ~4-8 hours round trip to visit a user group.  This will include one or two tanks of gas, depending on the type of vehicle you're driving.
* **Hotel**  
If I'm driving more than 4 hours in one direction to visit a user group, I probably want to get a hotel for the night.  
* **Lost wages**  
Odds are if I'm driving to a user group, I need to take the afternoon off work.  This means I'm burning PTO or (if you're like me), you're not billing time.

Organizations like [INETA](http://www.ineta.org) have programs to help offset the costs of for speakers.  For example, if I were to travel over 360 miles, INETA will reimburse me $200 for the trip.  That's pretty good and covers most of my costs of speaking.

**How can the user group help?**  
I understand that asking you to cover speaker costs is a huge thing.  So I'm not going to do that.  Still assume that speakers will come of their own freewill and will cover their own costs.

Consider this: Your goal as a user group leader is to promote the local technology scene.  You want to attract people to show up and learn, but you also want to attract great speakers!

A couple months ago, our user group started a process of giving out speaker gifts.  We don't promote it ("HEY EVERYONE!  LOOK AT US GIVING A SPEAKER GIFT!").  Instead, the speaker loves the thought behind the gift and keeps us in mind for a return visit in the future.

These speakers will then talk about you to their speaker friends.  "Hey, those guys at the Hampton Roads .NET group are really cool.  I definitely recommend getting on their calendar."

**What kind of gift can we give?**  
We just give a $50 Amazon gift card in one of the fancy boxes.  That's pretty good, and it's a cost we subsidize with sponsor money.

A couple months ago, I visited a group called [GANG](http://migang.org) where they gave me a engraved metal mug.  That was awesome, and it makes me definitely want to come back.

Why not start simple and give the speaker a thank you card signed by all the organizers and some of the attendees?  Every little bit you can do makes a difference.
