Trying to get your foot in the software developent industry is a pain in the butt.  And I would argue that it is exponently more difficult to do now than it was when I was getting my start back in 2006.  My purpose today isn't to defend the merits of why I would suggest that.  Instead, I want to discuss a slightly different controversial topic: portfolios.

Frankly, I feel like software development portfolios are kinda dumb and a waste of time.

Okay okay.  Stop.  Take a breath, and hear me out.

## What is the purpose of a portfolio?
Let's start here.  A portfolio serves a couple different roles in the life of an inspiring developer.  But essentially, `it serves as proof of one's skills, abilities, and potential in the future`.  That quote is taken directly from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_portfolio).

> Oh, here is a random website I build for my fake coffee company.

> This page shows off that I know enough React to build a to do application.

> Let's convert from eastern time zone to pacific with my fancy converter!

Not all portfolios are created equal - I understand that.  And when you don't have job experience, it is extremely difficult to show that you have an inkling of an idea of how to do what it is the job description states.

My point that I'm trying to get to is that portfolios are pretty throwaway, and definitely will not hold up to the test of time.

I have a better idea...

## Build a Product Instead
We all have really dumb ideas for software products.  

Maybe you have a favorite app, but it is missing 1-2 key features that would make it better.

Is there a problem you run into daily, and nothing exists to help you scratch that itch?

Instead of wasting time of silly portfolios, build that product.  You will use the exact same skills that you need to build portfolio pieces, but instead of something throwaway, you have a tangible product that can be profited from.

Made up example:  Kevin is barista at local coffee shop who decided that he'd make better money by learning how to program in JavaScript.  So Kevin goes spends his evenings reading blog posts and learning the necessary skills to be "employable".
