## Looking for a speaker?
I am always looking for new audiences to engage with.  I commonly speak on a variety of topics, including (but not limited to):

* ASP.NET
* C#
* JavaScript (Client and Server-side)
* node.js
* Microsoft Azure
* Freelancing
* Entreprenuership
* and more!

If your engagement is outside a five hour driving time of Chesapeake, VA, I humbly request some assistnance with travel.  As a fellow user group and conference organizer, I understand the limited funds for speakers but any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

## Talks

* [Application Insights - The Magic School Bus For Your Web Applications](/talks/application-insights)
